    "In this problem, we will calculate the InterQuartile Range (IQR). It is the difference between the first quartile and the third quartile. The IQR is used to measure how spread out the data points in a set are from the mean of the data set. The higher the IQR, the more spread out the data points; in contrast, the smaller the IQR, the more bunched up the data points are around the mean. The IQR range is one of many measurements used to measure how spread out the data points in a data set are. It is best used with other measurements such as the median and total range to build a complete picture of a data setâ€™s tendency to cluster around its mean."
