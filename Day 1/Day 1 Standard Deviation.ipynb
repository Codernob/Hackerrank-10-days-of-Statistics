    "Standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the average (mean or expected value). A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the average, while a high standard deviation means that the numbers are more spread out. In finance, standard deviations of price data are frequently used as a measure of volatility. In opinion polling, standard deviations are a key part of calculating margins of error.\r\n",
